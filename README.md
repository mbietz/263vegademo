# Vega Exploration

This is starter code for in-class exercises for UCI SWE 263P. 

It uses a [dataset of Bigfoot Sightings](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) compiled by [@timothyrenner](https://data.world/timothyrenner).

Additional sample Vega datasets can be found at the [vega-datasets github repository](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets).

**Note:** Because loading local files via JavaScript is blocked by most modern browsers as a security issue, you will need to run a local server to test your code. If using VSCode, try the Live Server or Live Preview extensions.
